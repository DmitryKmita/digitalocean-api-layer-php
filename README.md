# Basic Digital Ocean V2 API Layer

I have created this library to easily work with Digital Ocean V2 API.
Library is currently just a skeleton, will be improved in near future.

# Work in progress, next plans

- Replace static Config class by Config loader with .yml
- Separate every entity work in each service
- Account functionality
- Droplet functionality
- Domain functionality
- Image functionality
- SSH Keys functionality
- Regions functionality
- Sizes functionality
- Floating IPs functionality
- Tags functionality
- Basic Overview functionality (gets data and returns a nice overview of everything most important)
- Symfony Bundle layer using this library

Really waiting from DO to make possibility to get graphs, then maybe will implement even a dashboard/app.
